# UHC DB

Build with `tsc` lol

Run with `npm run-script start` (same way that it is run on app engine)

If you want to run it locally or deploy to app engine, then you must grab key files for datastore and oauth web client from Google cloud

The key file for the database should be called `db.json` and the key file for the oauth web client should be called `webclient.json`
